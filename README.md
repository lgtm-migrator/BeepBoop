Beep Boop API
=============

API and Discord bot for the Beep Boop soundboard.

Requirements
-----
ffmpeg is required for the bot to encode voice. Run `npm install --global ffmpeg-binaries` to install the required binaries.

Running the server/bot
----------------------
To get the API/Bot running you will need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and make changes as necessary. You need a discord application created [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and it must be converted to a bot.

To run the bot/api for development: `npm run dev`
